      "question": "1. Why is windowing crucial in the windowed periodogram, and how does it affect the spectral estimate?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Windowing eliminates spectral leakage entirely.",
        "b": "It increases frequency resolution by narrowing the main lobe.",
        "c": "It suppresses sidelobes at the cost of main lobe widening, reducing leakage.",
        "d": "It makes the estimator unbiased in the presence of colored noise."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Windowing reduces but does not eliminate leakage.",
        "b": "Windowing typically widens the main lobe, reducing resolution.",
        "c": "Correct — windowing suppresses sidelobes and reduces leakage, though it slightly degrades resolution.",
        "d": "Windowing doesn't affect bias due to colored noise directly."

    {
      "question": "2. What differentiates Welch's method from the standard Bartlett method in PSD estimation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Welch uses non-overlapping segments while Bartlett uses overlapping ones.",
        "b": "Welch averages windowed periodograms from overlapping segments to reduce variance.",
        "c": "Bartlett applies smoothing to autocorrelation before FFT, unlike Welch.",
        "d": "Welch provides higher resolution by increasing DFT length per segment."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The reverse is true — Welch uses overlapping, Bartlett does not.",
        "b": "Correct — Welch reduces variance using overlapping and windowed segments.",
        "c": "This describes Blackman-Tukey, not Bartlett.",
        "d": "Welch may sacrifice resolution due to shorter segments."

    {
      "question": "3. In the Blackman-Tukey method, what is the role of applying a window to the autocorrelation function before computing the spectrum?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It reduces bias introduced by high-lag correlation values.",
        "b": "It removes the need for zero-padding before FFT.",
        "c": "It enhances frequency resolution by sharpening peaks.",
        "d": "It ensures time-domain symmetry of the signal."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct — the window smooths the autocorrelation, reducing variance and limiting the effect of unreliable high-lag values.",
        "b": "Zero-padding may still be needed for interpolation but is not the purpose of windowing.",
        "c": "Windowing reduces resolution while controlling leakage.",
        "d": "Time-domain symmetry is unrelated to this step."

    {
      "question": "4. Which fundamental assumption allows the correlogram method to estimate the power spectral density from autocorrelation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The signal is periodic and band-limited.",
        "b": "The signal is ergodic in correlation and wide-sense stationary.",
        "c": "The noise in the signal is Gaussian white.",
        "d": "The signal has a finite number of frequency components."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Periodicity is not required in the correlogram.",
        "b": "Correct — WSS and ergodicity allow time averages to approximate ensemble averages.",
        "c": "Noise type may influence results but isn’t a prerequisite.",
        "d": "This would describe a sinusoidal model, not the correlogram assumption."

      "difficulty": "intermediate"

    {
      "question": "5. Why does the Bartlett method result in reduced variance in spectral estimates at the expense of resolution?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It uses fewer DFT points by design.",
        "b": "It estimates fewer frequency bins by truncating the signal.",
        "c": "Segmenting the signal reduces the effective DFT length, lowering resolution.",
        "d": "It applies a high-pass filter to the signal before segmentation."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "DFT points can remain the same — it's the segment length that matters.",
        "b": "Bartlett doesn’t truncate the signal — it divides it.",
        "c": "Correct — shorter segments mean coarser frequency resolution.",
        "d": "High-pass filtering is unrelated to Bartlett’s averaging mechanism."

      "difficulty": "intermediate"

      "question": "6. Suppose you apply Welch’s method to a signal with significant low-frequency content. What kind of window would help reduce leakage while preserving that low-frequency information?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A rectangular window.",
        "b": "A Hamming or Hann window.",
        "c": "A Blackman window with minimal side lobes.",
        "d": "A Kaiser window with large β value."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Rectangular windows have high side lobes and increase leakage.",
        "b": "Hamming and Hann provide a good balance for general spectral estimation.",
        "c": "Correct — Blackman is ideal for minimizing leakage, though it further reduces resolution.",
        "d": "Kaiser with large β suppresses leakage but may be too aggressive for low-frequency preservation."

      "answers": {
        "a": "It cannot handle non-stationary signals.",
        "b": "It always overestimates high-frequency power.",
        "c": "It has inherently low frequency resolution due to non-segmented averaging.",
        "d": "It introduces spectral nulls due to autocorrelation bias."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "True for all WSS-based estimators, but not unique to correlogram.",
        "b": "Bias depends on lag estimation, not specific overestimation.",
        "c": "Correct — unlike segment-based methods, resolution is limited by single long-time autocorrelation.",
        "d": "Bias introduces distortion, but not spectral nulls specifically."

    {
      "question": "8. What effect does overlapping segments have in Welch's method compared to Bartlett's method?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It reduces resolution but improves detection of weak tones.",
        "b": "It increases spectral leakage due to redundant data.",
        "c": "It improves variance reduction without further resolution loss.",
        "d": "It causes windowing artifacts to accumulate."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Overlap doesn't reduce resolution directly — segment length does.",
        "b": "Overlap does not increase leakage.",
        "c": "Correct — overlapping improves variance reduction by increasing the number of independent estimates.",
        "d": "Artifacts are minimized due to proper windowing."

    {
      "question": "9. How does the Blackman-Tukey method trade off between resolution and variance?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By using zero-padding to interpolate the spectrum.",
        "b": "By truncating the autocorrelation and applying a smoothing window.",
        "c": "By increasing overlap between segments for averaging.",
        "d": "By averaging the magnitude spectrum instead of the power spectrum."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Zero-padding helps with visual resolution, but not the variance-resolution tradeoff.",
        "b": "Correct — this combination reduces variance at the cost of frequency resolution.",
        "c": "That describes Welch, not Blackman-Tukey.",
        "d": "Averaging magnitudes is not part of Blackman-Tukey."

        "c": "Blackman-Tukey",
        "d": "Welch"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The periodogram is inconsistent — its variance does not decrease with more data.",
        "b": "Correct — Bartlett produces consistent estimates by averaging uncorrelated segments.",
        "c": "Depends on assumptions; can be biased and inconsistent depending on window choice.",
        "d": "Welch is more consistent than periodogram but not strictly consistent in all cases."
